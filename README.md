Project Title: Predicting Orders in Different Product Categories Using Machine Learning and TensorFlow
Project Description:
The project involved analyzing and predicting the number of orders in various product categories during the Diwali season using a structured dataset. This dataset included features like customer demographics (gender, age, marital status), purchase behavior (amount spent, product category), and other attributes. The primary goal was to develop a predictive model to forecast future order volumes across different product categories, enabling businesses to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

Key Steps and Techniques:

Data Preprocessing:

Performed data cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing data.
Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized purchase trends across product categories and demographic groups.
Identified key factors influencing order volumes using correlation analysis and feature importance.
Modeling Approaches:

Developed regression models using machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Built a neural network using TensorFlow to capture complex relationships between features for accurate predictions.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
The TensorFlow-based model outperformed traditional methods, achieving high accuracy in predicting order volumes.
Outcome:
The project successfully demonstrated the ability to predict order volumes for various product categories with high precision. The insights derived helped in identifying demand patterns and optimizing resources for targeted marketing campaigns.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

This project showcases strong skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, with a focus on practical business applications.
